# Headlight Mechanics Simulations
This project focuses on simulating the operational principles of automotive headlights, based on the physical properties of both flat and parabolic mirrors.

It includes a simulation that demonstrates the fundamental working mechanism of the Adaptive Front-Lighting System (AFS), which enables the controlled rotation of the parabolic headlamp in response to steering angles and road conditions.

The entire project was developed in Python, utilizing the Manim library for creating visualizations and animations. A comprehensive PDF report is also provided, detailing the development process and the theoretical background underlying the simulations.
